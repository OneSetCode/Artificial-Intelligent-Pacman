# Pacman
This project implements several artificial intelligence algorithms including BFS/DFS Search, Informed Search, Adversarial Search, Efficient Adversarial Search, Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Markov Decision Processes, Reinforcement Learning such as Q-leaning, Graphical Models, Bayes' Net Sampling, and Dynamic Bayes' Nets and Particle Filters to help the pacman eat the foods and avoid the ghosts, and obtain the highest score.
